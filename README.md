I used PyCharm Community Edition 4.5.4 for the test so if desired it should open fine pointing PyCharm to that folder. I’m also just as happy in a unix environment using Vim/Tmux. I used Python 2.7.5 for this exercise.
 
To run please use the following commands from within the AnimalLogicTest folder (assuming python 2.7.5 is installed)
 
python –m unittest discover                                                                       - to see unittest coverage
python main.py –file data/personal_data.xml                                    - to show xml output
python main.py –file data/personal_data.json                                   - to show json output
python main.py –file data/personal_data.xml --help_ff                 - to show querying available formats
python main.py –file data/personal_data.xml –df pretty              - to show xml output in a different format
python main.py –file data/personal_data.json –df pretty             - to show json output in a different format
 
Thank you for your time and consideration I look forward to hearing from you once you’ve had time to review.

Apologies for the issues getting this via Dropbox I can only claim post traumatic stress from watching England get mauled by Australia 13-33 :/
